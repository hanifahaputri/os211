TOP 10 LINKS WEEK 09
1. [Non-volatile Memory](https://www.javatpoint.com/non-volatile-memory)<br>
Non-volatile memory is a very advanced storage technology. It does not use continuous power to keep the data or program files located on the computer so that it becomes an effective power saver.

2. [Hard-Disk Drive](https://www.javatpoint.com/hdd)<br>
HDD is an electro-mechanical storage device, which is an abbreviation of Hard Disk Drive. It uses magnetic storage for storing and retrieving the digital data. It is a non-volatile storage device.

3. [RAM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram-and-read-only-memory-rom/)<br>
It is also called as read write memory or the main memory or the primary memory. The programs and data that the CPU requires during execution of a program are stored in this memory. It is a volatile memory as the data loses when the power is turned off. RAM is further classified into two types- SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic Random Access Memory).

4. [ROM](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/random-access-memory-ram-and-read-only-memory-rom/)<br>
Stores crucial information essential to operate the system, like the program essential to boot the computer. It is not volatile. Always retains its data. Used in embedded systems or where the programming needs no change. Used in calculators and peripheral devices. ROM is further classified into 4 types- ROM, PROM, EPROM, and EEPROM.

5. [Error Detection & Correction](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/computer_logical_organization/error_codes.htm)<br>
Whenever a message is transmitted, it may get scrambled by noise or data may get corrupted. To avoid this, we use error-detecting codes which are additional data added to a given digital message to help us detect if an error occurred during transmission of the message. A simple example of error-detecting code is parity check.

6. [Disk Scheduling Algorithms](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-scheduling-algorithms/)<br>
Disk scheduling is done by operating systems to schedule I/O requests arriving for the disk. Disk scheduling is also known as I/O scheduling. Known algorithms are: FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, CSCAN, LOOK, CLOOK,LIFO, N-Step SCAN, FSCAN.

7. [Disk Formatting](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/disk-formatting/)<br>
Disk formatting is a process to configure the data-storage devices such as hard-drive, floppy disk and flash drive when we are going to use them for the very first time or we can say initial usage. Disk formatting is usually required when new operating system is going to be used by the user. It is also done when there is space issue and we require additional space for the storage of more data in the drives.

8. [Priority-Based Scheduling](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_process_scheduling_algorithms.htm)<br>
Priority Scheduling merupakan algoritma penjadwalan yang mendahulukan proses yang memiliki prioritas tertinggi. Setiap proses memiliki prioritasnya masing-masing. Priority scheduling juga dapat dijalankan secara preemptive maupun nonpreemptive.

9. [Swap-Space Management](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/swap-space-management-in-operating-system/)<br>
Swap-Swap management is another low-level task pf the operating system. Disk space is used as an extension of main memory by the virtual memory. 

10. [RAID (Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/raid-redundant-arrays-of-independent-disks/)<br>
RAID, or “Redundant Arrays of Independent Disks” is a technique which makes use of a combination of multiple disks instead of using a single disk for increased performance, data redundancy or both. The term was coined by David Patterson, Garth A. Gibson, and Randy Katz at the University of California, Berkeley in 1987.
